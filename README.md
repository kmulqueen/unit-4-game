# unit-4-game

This is a game using jQuery called the "Crystal Collector Game". The idea behind the game is having the user reach a specific randomly generated number between 19 - 120. If the user's score goes over that specific number, they lose and the next round starts. If the user's score is equal to the specific number, they win and the next round starts. 

The user accumulates a score by clicking on 4 crystals that have a randomly generated value between 1 - 12. These values are not visible to the user until they click on the crystal, in which case the value of that crystal is added to their total score.
